# trail mix lab (wdd231 – final project)

Framework‑free, three‑page website with ES modules: data fetching, dynamic rendering, filters, accessible modal, localStorage, responsive nav, and an HTML form with a display/action page.

- `/index.html` — home with featured items.
- `/explore.html` — catalog with filters, sort, and saved mix.
- `/contact.html` — contact/order form; submits to `/form-success.html`.
- `/form-success.html` — displays submitted fields (URLSearchParams).
- `/attributions.html` — attributions page.

**Folders:** `css/`, `js/`, `data/`, `assets/`, `images/` (all lowercase, no spaces). Place this folder in your repo as `/final/`.
