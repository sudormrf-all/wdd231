# Trail Mix Lab (WDD231 – Final Project)

A three‑page, framework‑free website demonstrating modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with ES modules. It includes data fetching, dynamic rendering, filters, a11y‑friendly modal dialog, localStorage, responsive navigation, and an HTML form with a dedicated action page that displays submitted data.

## Pages
- `/index.html` — Home/landing with hero and featured items (top‑rated).
- `/explore.html` — Complete catalog with filters, sorting, modal details, and “Your mix” saved in localStorage.
- `/contact.html` — Contact/Order form that packs the saved mix into a hidden field; preview included.
- `/form-success.html` — Form action page that renders submitted data (does not count toward the three‑page requirement).
- `/attributions.html` — Simple attributions page.

## How to use
1. Place this folder in your GitHub `wdd231` repo as `/final/` or similar.
2. Enable GitHub Pages on the repo. Update the “Final” link on your week‑1 page to point to `/final/index.html`.
3. Update the footer “Project Demo Video” link on all pages to your public recording.
4. Optionally edit `meta[name="author"]` tags.
5. Lighthouse: aim for solid scores (A11y, Best Practices, SEO).

No external libraries, templates, or drag‑and‑drop builders were used.
